* Coding issues
 * Collector (non-singleton) to handle Operators and wavefunction buffers more easy

* QDng input
 * xsl scheme for input definition
 * Loops (see Program types)
 * "macros" for shorter defs., eg. Tkin on a multistate operator

 * Compressed storage => k-space, set zero, gzip/bzip2 compression
 * Seperate FileSingle class into specialized parts (WaveFunction->Multistate, other types of data)
   => Special fileWF class (DONE)

* Propgramm types
 * Eigen (=> SPO,Cheby with real exponents) (DONE)
 * OCT (Krotov, freq-shape) (DONE)
 * Pump Probe Spectroscopy simulation
 * Loops in input with formatable loop variable in xml input

 * -"- Hermitian 
 * Band Matrix

* Operators to implement
 * Dipole Operator (DONE)
 * SIL (DONE)
 * SOD (Worth implementing?)
 * Projection Operator (DONE)
 * Extend NAC Operator to N-Dimensions

 * efficient SPO Scheme (DONE)
 * SPO for N-States (DONE, GSPO)
 * matrix system (DONE)

* FFT
 * Decouple Intialiazation (DONE)
 * Plan buffering (DONE)
 * MPI-FFT (how to combine with data distribution?)
