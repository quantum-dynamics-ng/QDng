* Coding issues
 * Add Output to operators Init functions. [planed for alpha-0.7]
 * Cleanup optimization flags => configure should decide (DONE)

* Testing
 * Define test inputs + evaluating script. (DONE)

* QDng input
 * xsl scheme for input definition [planed for alpha-0.7] (DONE)
 * Loops (DONE) 
 * "macros" for shorter defs., eg. Tkin on a multistate operator [planed for alpha-0.7]
 * GUI Frontend to compose input. [planed for alpha-0.7 needed?]

* MPI [planed for alpha-0.7 ?]
 * Vector Classes
 * Matrix Classes
 * Check loops over elements
 * transparent task/calc level scheme

* I/O
 * MPI-IO
 * HDF5
 * Mem-chached file buffer (in FileSingle, really needed?) (DONE => WFBuffer)
 * Seperate FileSingle class into specialized parts (WaveFunction->Multistate, other types of data)
   => Special fileWF class (DONE)

* Programm types
 * Pump Probe Spectroscopy simulation

* Matrix Class
 * Efficient Storage Scheme for Symmetric
 * -"- Hermitian 
 * Band Matrix

* Operators to implement
 * SOD (Worth implementing? => No!)


* FFT
 * MPI-FFT (how to combine with data distribution?)

* Density Matrix operations
 * SPO propagator
 * Faber propagator
 * basic operation types for density matrices
