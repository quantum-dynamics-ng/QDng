* Coding issues
 * Add Output to operators Init functions. [planed for alpha-0.7]

* QDng input
 * xsl scheme for input definition [planed for alpha-0.7] (DONE)
 * "macros" for shorter defs., eg. Tkin on a multistate operator [planed for alpha-0.7]
 * GUI Frontend to compose input. [planed for alpha-0.7 needed?]

* MPI [planed for alpha-0.7 ?]
 * Vector Classes
 * Matrix Classes
 * Check loops over elements
 * transparent task/calc level scheme (how can this work?)
 * First step: MPI support for Multistates - split stride support
 * MTOCT - Split target support
 * Second Step: Split data support (needs special fft handling)

* CUDA support
 * Memory mangement
 * CuFFT integration


* I/O
 * MPI-IO
 * HDF5

* Programm types
 * Pump Probe Spectroscopy simulation ?

* Matrix Class
 * Efficient Storage Scheme for Symmetric
 * -"- Hermitian 
 * Band Matrix

* FFT
 * MPI-FFT (how to combine with data distribution?)

* Density Matrix operations
 * SPO propagator
 * Faber propagator
 * basic operation types for density matrices
