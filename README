The following software ist required:
 * libxml2
 * lapack
 * blas

The fftw3 is included.
Use the CFLAGS=-fPIC configure option to compile the fftw3 as a library
If a builddir is used fftw has to be confgiured manually in $builddir/src/fftw

Use ./genbs to generate the build system (configure)

Use the --with-matlab=path (e.g /opt/adm/matlab7.9_test/) configure option to enable the mex Functions.
To avoid library conflicts use matlab from "/opt/adm/matlab7.9_test/"
