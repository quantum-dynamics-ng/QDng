The following software ist required:
 * libxml2
 * lapack
 * blas
 * fftw3-3.2.2

The fftw3 is included.
Use the CFLAGS=-fPIC configure option to compile the fftw3 as a library
If a builddir is used fftw has to be confgiured manually in $builddir/src/fftw

Use ./genbs to generate the build system (configure)

* Matlab support
 Use the --with-matlab=path (e.g /opt/adm/matlab7.9_test/) configure option to enable the mex Functions.
 To avoid library conflicts use matlab from "/opt/adm/matlab7.9_test/"
 
 To compile the matlab support a static version of the fftw3 library must be used.
 configure --enable-shared --enable-static --with-pic
