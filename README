The following software ist required:
 * libxml2
 * lapack
 * blas
 * fftw3-3.2.2 (with openmp support)
 For WF compression
 * zlib (optional)
 * libbzip (optional)

Use ./genbs to generate the build system (configure) after a fresh git clone

* Matlab support
 Use the --with-matlab=path (e.g /opt/adm/matlab7.9_test/) configure option to enable the mex Functions.
 
 To compile the matlab support a static version of the fftw3 library must be used.
 The --with-staticfftw option asures this.
 
 The fftw package has to be compiled seperately and installed.
 Use the follwing options to configure the fftw package:
 --enable-shared --enable-static --with-pic --with-openmp
 This options should create a set of libraries which are suitable for the matlab interface
 as well as for a parallel standalone version.
