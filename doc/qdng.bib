    abstract = {{A propagation method for the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation was
studied leading to a general scheme of solving ode type equations. Standard
space discretization of time-dependent pde's usually results in system of ode's
of the form u\_t -Gu = s where G is a operator (matrix) and u is a
time-dependent solution vector. Highly accurate methods, based on polynomial
approximation of a modified exponential evolution operator, had been developed
already for this type of problems where G is a linear, time independent matrix
and s is a constant vector. In this paper we will describe a new algorithm for
the more general case where s is a time-dependent r.h.s vector. An iterative
version of the new algorithm can be applied to the general case where G depends
on t or u. Numerical results for Schr\"odinger equation with time-dependent
potential and to non-linear Schr\"odinger equation will be presented.}},

    abstract = {{High-harmonic generation provides an attractive light source of coherent radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) and soft-x-ray regions of the spectrum and allows for the production of single attosecond pulses or pulse trains. This Colloquium covers the control of high-harmonic spectra by temporal and spatial pulse shaping of the driving laser pulses and its implications on time-resolved XUV spectroscopy and attosecond pulse shaping. It summarizes important steps for extending existing pulse shaping techniques and control schemes from the near-infrared or visible part to shorter wavelengths. Using adaptive pulse shaping of the driving laser pulses, several groups have demonstrated control of the high-harmonic spectrum, including the author's work on the complete control over the XUV spectrum of high-order harmonics, generated in a gas-filled hollow fiber. It is possible to achieve both the enhancement and the suppression of single or several selected harmonic orders. These arbitrarily shaped soft-x-ray spectra will allow for important modifications of the resulting harmonic pulses in the temporal domain. This constitutes first steps towards direct attosecond pulse shaping in the soft-x-ray domain. Moreover, high-harmonic generation in a hollow-core fiber can be enhanced by coupling into a single fiber mode using a feedback-controlled adaptive two-dimensional spatial light modulator.}},

    abstract = {{This paper addresses a very fundamental and important problem in the numerical analysis of atomic and molecular systems: How to discretize Hamiltonians with divergent potential terms, such as Coulomb singularities. At the point of a Coulomb singularity, the wave function cannot be described by a Taylor series expansion, which results in problems when standard discretization schemes are used. We propose using the known asymptotic form of the wave function near the singularity instead of the (nonexistent) Taylor series. This principle, namely discretization by asymptotic behavior correspondence (ABC), is employed in this paper for obtaining grid-discretizations for the Coulomb potential in Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. We show that computations with the ABC discretization are faster and more precise than with a naive discretization by orders of magnitude. The ABC discretization is well suited for the standard numerical time propagators, such as the Crank-Nicholson, Peaceman-Rachford, and leapfrog schemes. We use the latter, since it is faster and has the same order of accuracy. The leapfrog scheme is generalized to allow absorbing potentials at the grid boundaries.}},

    abstract = {{Optimal control theory and optimal control experiments are state-of-the-art tools to control quantum systems. Both methods have been demonstrated successfully for numerous applications in molecular physics, chemistry and biology. Modulated light pulses could be realized driving these various control processes. Next to the control efficence, a key issue is the understanding of the control mechanism. An obvious way is to seek support from theory. However, the underlying search strategies in theory and experiment towards the optimal laser field differ. While the optimal control theory operates in the time domain, optimal control experiments optimize the laser fields in the frequency domain. This also implies that both search procedures experience a different bias and follow different pathways on the search landscape. In this perspective we review our recent developments in optimal control theory and their applications. Especially, we focus on approaches, which close the gap between theory and experiment. To this extend we followed two ways. One uses sophisticated optimization algorithms, which enhance the capabilities of optimal control experiments. The other is to extend and modify the optimal control theory formalism in order to mimic the experimental conditions.}},

Since a perturbative approach is no longer valid at these intensities, the full TDHF equations are used to propagate the electronic density. A unitary transform approach is combined with the modified midpoint method to provide a stable and efficient algorithm to integrate these equations. The behavior of H in an intense oscillating field computed using the TDHF method with a STO-3G basis set reproduces the analytic solution for the two-state coherent excitation model. For H with a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set, the TDHF results are nearly indistinguishable from calculations using the full time-dependent Schrodinger equation. In an oscillating field of 3.17 [times] 10 W cm and 456 nm, the molecular orbital energies, electron populations, and atomic charges of H follow the field adiabatically. As the field intensity is increased, the response becomes more complicated as a result of contributions from excited states. Simulations of N show even greater complexity, yet the average charge still follows the field adiabatically.}},

    abstract = {{The rise time of intense radiation determines the maximum field strength atoms can be exposed to before their polarizability dramatically drops due to the detachment of an outer electron. Recent progress in ultrafast optics has allowed the generation of ultraintense light pulses comprising merely a few field oscillation cycles. The arising intensity gradient allows electrons to survive in their bound atomic state up to external field strengths many times higher than the binding Coulomb field and gives rise to ionization rates comparable to the light frequency, resulting in a significant extension of the frontiers of nonlinear optics and (nonrelativistic) high-field physics. Implications include the generation of coherent harmonic radiation up to kiloelectronvolt photon energies and control of the atomic dipole moment on a subfemtosecond (1fs=10-15 s) time scale. This review presents the landmarks of the 30-odd-year evolution of ultrashort-pulse laser physics and technology culminating in the generation of intense few-cycle light pulses and discusses the impact of these pulses on high-field physics. Particular emphasis is placed on high-order harmonic emission and single subfemtosecond extreme ultraviolet/x-ray pulse generation. These as well as other strong-field processes are governed directly by the electric-field evolution, and hence their full control requires access to the (absolute) phase of the light carrier. We shall discuss routes to its determination and control, which will, for the first time, allow access to the electromagnetic fields in light waves and control of high-field interactions with never-before-achieved precision.}},

    abstract = {{Generalized curvilinear coordinates, as, e.g., polyspherical coordinates, are in general better adapted to the resolution of the nuclear Schr\"{o}dinger equation than rectilinear ones like the normal mode coordinates. However, analytical expressions of the kinetic energy operators (KEOs) for molecular systems in polyspherical coordinates may be prohibitively complicated for large systems. In this paper we propose a method to generate a KEO numerically and bring it to a form practicable for dynamical calculations. To examine the new method we calculated vibrational spectra and eigenenergies for nitrous acid (HONO) and compare it with results obtained with an exact analytical KEO derived previously [F. Richter, P. Rosmus, F. Gatti, and H.-D. Meyer, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 6072 (2004)]10.1063/1.1651051. In a second example we calculated π → π* photoabsorption spectrum and eigenenergies of ethene (C2H4) and compared it with previous work [M. R. Brill, F. Gatti, D. Lauvergnat, and H.-D. Meyer, Chem. Phys. 338, 186 (2007)]10.1016/j.chemphys.2007.04.002. In this ethene study the dimensionality was reduced from 12 to 6 by freezing six internal coordinates. Results for both molecules show that the proposed method for obtaining an approximate KEO is reliable for dynamical calculations. The error in eigenenergies was found to be below 1 cm−1 for most states calculated.}},

    abstract = {The time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation models the quantum nature of molecular processes. Numerical simulations of these models help in understanding and predicting the outcome of chemical reactions. In this thesis, several numerical algorithms for evolving the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation with an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian are studied and their performance is compared for the example of a pump-probe and an interference experiment for the rubidium diatom. For the important application of interaction dynamics between a molecule and a time-dependent field, an efficient fourth order Magnus--Lanczos propagator is derived. Error growth in the equation is analyzed by means of a posteriori error estimation theory and the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian is exploited to yield a low-cost global error estimate for numerical time evolution. Based on this theory, an \$h,p\$-adaptive Magnus--Lanczos propagator is developed that is capable to control the global error. Numerical experiments for various model systems (including a three dimensional model and a dissociative configuration) show that the error estimate is effective and the number of time steps needed to meet a certain accuracy is reduced due to adaptivity. Moreover, the thesis proposes an efficient numerical optimization framework for the design of femtosecond laser pulses with the aim of manipulating chemical reactions. This task can be formulated as an optimal control problem with the electric field of the laser being the control variable. In the algorithm described here, the electric field is Fourier transformed and it is optimized over the Fourier coefficients. Then, the frequency band is narrowed which facilitates the application of a quasi-Newton method. Furthermore, the restrictions on the frequency band make sure that the optimized pulse can be realized by the experimental equipment. A numerical comparison shows that the new method can outperform the Krotov method, which is a standard scheme in this field.},

We compare the performance of the PML to that of a monomial complex absorbing potential, a transmission-free complex absorbing potential, and to exterior complex scaling. In particular, the reflection properties due to the numerical treatment are investigated. We conclude that the PML is accurate and efficient, especially if high accuracy is of significance.

It has been and still is the goal of many experiments to understand these reaction dynamics and the different reaction mechanisms they lead to. We will show how rate coefficients and cross-sections for anion-molecule reactions are measured and interpreted to yield information on the underlying dynamics. We will also present more detailed approaches that study either the transient reaction complex or the energy- and angle-resolved scattering of negative ions with neutral molecules....}},

The light is detuned by more than an octave, in this case by hundreds of nanometers, from any optical transition, making particle excitation and spontaneous emission negligible. The enhancement of light scattering into the resonator is explained quantitatively as an interference effect of light waves emitted by a classical driven dipole oscillator.

We build a fully explicit, time-reversible time-stepping algorithm to approximate the solution of the Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics. The algorithm is based on a splitting between the kinetic and potential part of the Hamiltonian operator, as well as on a splitting of the potential into its local quadratic approximation and the remainder. The algorithm is robust in the semiclassical limit. It reduces to the Strang splitting of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the limit of the full basis set, and it advances positions and momenta by the St\"{o}rmer–Verlet method for the classical equations of motion. The algorithm allows for the treatment of multiparticle problems by thinning out the basis according to a hyperbolic cross approximation and of high-dimensional problems by Hartree-type approximations in a moving coordinate frame.}},

Herein we review the current understanding of the bioluminescent process from a chemical functionality perspective based on those investigations. Three key components are emphasized: the chemiluminophore, the electron-donating fragment, and how these are affected by the substrate–enzyme interaction. The understanding is based on details of how the peroxide OO bond supports the production of electronically excited products and how the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism, with the aid of an electron-donating group, lowers the activation barrier to support a reaction occurs in living organisms. For the substrate–enzyme complex it is demonstrated that the enzyme can affect the hydrogen-bonding around the CT-controlling group, resulting in a mechanism for color modulation. Finally, we analyse other luciferin–luciferase systems and compare them to the key chemical functionalities of the fragments of the luciferin–luciferase complex with respect to similarities and differences.}},

Motivated by the standardized basis sets used in electronic structure theory, we develop a scheme for optimizing the width parameters for frozen Gaussian nuclear basis functions. The optimization approach maximizes the overlap between a reference ground state vibrational wavefunction in internal coordinates and a wavefunction determined by the product of complex Gaussians in Cartesian coordinates. After optimizing the parameters using a test set of over 100 molecules, the average width parameters are determined for a set of common atoms (H, C, O, N, F, S and Cl). The parameters are tested for excited state dynamics of ethylene and benzene using the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method.}},

An infinite order sudden approximation and Radau coordinates for the stretching modes are used. The scattering problem is formulated in hyperspherical coordinates. A potential energy surface of Wang, Zhu, and Hase is used. It is found that this surface can reproduce the experimentally observed independence of the rate constant on the internal temperature of CH3Br only if it is scaled to enable the transition state geometry to agree with high level ab initio data.

For instance, cesium molecules initially formed via photoassociation of cold cesium atoms are in several vibrational levels {nu} of the electronic ground state. We applied a broadband femtosecond laser that redistributes the vibrational population in the ground state via a few electronic excitation/spontaneous emission cycles. The laser pulses are shaped to remove the excitation frequency band of the {nu} = 0 level, preventing re-excitation from that state. We observed a fast and efficient accumulation ([\~{}]70\% of the initially detected molecules) in the lowest vibrational level, {nu} = 0, of the singlet electronic state. The validity of this incoherent depopulation pumping method is very general and opens exciting prospects for laser cooling and manipulation of molecules. 10.1126/science.1159496},

In our experiment, we create a translationally ultracold, dense quantum gas of molecules bound by more than 1000 wave numbers in the electronic ground state. Specifically, we stimulate with 80\% efficiency, a two-photon transfer of molecules associated on a Feshbach resonance from a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. In the process, the initial loose, long-range electrostatic bond of the Feshbach molecule is coherently transformed into a tight chemical bond. We demonstrate coherence of the transfer in a Ramsey-type experiment and show that the molecular sample is not heated during the transfer. Our results show that the preparation of a quantum gas of molecules in specific rovibrational states is possible and that the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules in their rovibronic ground state is within reach. 10.1126/science.1159909}},

In particular, samples of ground-state molecules at ultralow temperatures and high number densities will facilitate new quantum-gas studies3 and future applications in quantum information science4. However, high phase-space densities for molecular samples are not readily attainable because efficient cooling techniques such as laser cooling are lacking. Here we produce an ultracold and dense sample of molecules in a single hyperfine level of the rovibronic ground state with each molecule individually trapped in the motional ground state of an optical lattice well. Starting from a zero-temperature atomic Mott-insulator state5 with optimized double-site occupancy6, weakly bound dimer molecules are efficiently associated on a Feshbach resonance7 and subsequently transferred to the rovibronic ground state by a stimulated four-photon process with >50\% efficiency. The molecules are trapped in the lattice and have a lifetime of 8 s.

Thermal motion randomizes molecular encounters and diminishes the effects of external radiation or static electromagnetic fields on intermolecular interactions. The effects of the thermal motion can be reduced by cooling molecular gases to low temperatures. At temperatures near or below 1 K, the collision energy of molecules becomes less significant than perturbations due to external fields. At the same time, inelastic scattering and chemical reactions may be very efficient in low-temperature molecular gases. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that collisions of molecules at temperatures below 1 K can be manipulated by external electromagnetic fields and to discuss possible applications of cold controlled chemistry. The discussion focuses on molecular interactions at cold (0.001-2 K) and ultracold (<0.001 K) temperatures and is based on both recent theoretical and experimental work.

    abstract = {{It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms1, 2, 3, leading to rapid advances in a wide array of fields. Laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications4. For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments that lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole–dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole–dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulations of condensed-matter systems5 and in quantum computation6. Also, ultracold molecules could provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics7, 8 and for tests of fundamental symmetries9, 10, 11. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of the polar molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers12, we have observed both Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces that reduce the transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam substantially, to a few millikelvin or less. At present, the only technique for producing ultracold molecules is to bind together ultracold alkali atoms through Feshbach resonance13 or photoassociation14. However, proposed applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular energy-level structures (for example unpaired electronic spin5, 9, 11, 15, Omega doublets16 and so on). Our method provides an alternative route to ultracold molecules. In particular, it bridges the gap between ultracold (submillikelvin) temperatures and the \~{}1-K temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (for example with cryogenic buffer-gas cooling17 or decelerated supersonic beams18). Ultimately, our technique should allow the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct from bialkalis.}},

    abstract = {{Building a scalable quantum processor requires coherent control and preservation of quantum coherence in a large-scale quantum system. Mesoscopic solid-state systems such as Josephson junctions and quantum dots feature robust control techniques using local electrical signals and self-evident scaling; however, in general the quantum states decohere rapidly. In contrast, quantum optical systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms exhibit much better coherence properties, but their miniaturization and integration with electrical circuits remains a challenge. Here we describe methods for the integration of a single-particle system—an isolated polar molecule—with mesoscopic solid-state devices in a way that produces robust, coherent, quantum-level control. Our setup provides a scalable cavity-QED-type quantum computer architecture, where entanglement of distant qubits stored in long-lived rotational molecular states is achieved via exchange of microwave photons.}},

Previous experimental demonstrations have been implemented with optical systems that used both discrete and continuous variables4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and with liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance10. Here we report unconditional teleportation5 of massive particle qubits using atomic (9Be+) ions confined in a segmented ion trap, which aids individual qubit addressing. We achieve an average fidelity of 78 per cent, which exceeds the fidelity of any protocol that does not use entanglement11.

    abstract = {{Quantum scattering calculations on the SN2 reaction Cl−+CH3Cl→ClCH3+Cl− are reported. The rotating bond approximation (RBA) has been adapted so that three degrees of freedom including the C–Cl stretching vibration and the CH3 umbrella mode are treated explicitly. The calculations have been done with minor modifications of a potential due to Vande Linde and Hase. It is found that initial excitation of the C–Cl vibration has a large effect on the reaction probabilities, while excitation of the CH3 umbrella vibration is less significant. The reaction is dominated by scattering resonances with lifetimes ranging from 0.1 to 10 ps. It is found that the length of the C–Cl bond at the transition state of the reaction has a particularly pronounced effect on the reaction probabilities. The magnitude of the quantum reaction probabilities compares quite well with those calculated using the quasiclassical trajectory method. {\copyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.}},

    abstract = {{This paper reviews the work on cavity quantum electrodynamics of free atoms. In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with. The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with low quality factors  Q  and the strong coupling when high- Q  cavities are involved. The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field. In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in this area is also given.}},

In the quantum dynamics calculations Radau coordinates were employed to describe the Cl–C and C–Br stretching modes. Making use of the filter diagonalization method and an optical potential, bound states as well as resonance states up to energies far above the dissociation threshold have been calculated. The resonance widths fluctuate over several orders of magnitude. In addition to a majority of Feshbach-type resonances there are also exceedingly long-lived shape resonances, which can only decay by tunneling. Owing to a smaller width of the potential barrier and a larger density of states, tunneling through the barrier is more important for Cl−+CH3Br than for Cl−+CH3Cl despite the larger total mass of this system. Excitation of the C–Br stretching vibration enhances the tunneling probability of the entrance channel complex. {\copyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.}},

    abstract = {{Time-independent quantum scattering calculations have been carried out on the Walden inversion SN2 reaction Cl−+CH3Cl′(v1,v2,v3)→ClCH3(v1′,v2′,v3′)+Cl′−. The two C–Cl stretching modes (quantum numbers v3 and v3′) and the totally symmetric internal modes of the methyl group (C–H stretching vibration, v1 and v1′, and inversion bending vibration, v2 and v2′) are treated explicitly. A four-dimensional coupled cluster potential energy surface is employed. The scattering problem is formulated in hyperspherical coordinates using the exact Hamiltonian and exploiting the full symmetry of the problem. Converged state-selected reaction probabilities and product distributions have been calculated up to 6100 cm−1 above the vibrational ground state of CH3Cl, i.e., up to initial vibrational excitation (2,0,0). In order to extract all scattering resonances, the energetic grid was chosen to be very fine, partly down to a resolution of 10−12 cm−1. Up to 2500 cm−1 translational energy, initial excitation of the umbrella bending vibration, (0,1,0), is more efficient for reaction than exciting the C–Cl stretching mode, (0,0,1). The combined excitation of both vibrations results in a synergic effect, i.e., a considerably higher reaction probability than expected from the sum of both independent excitations, even higher than (0,0,2) up to 1500 cm−1 translational energy. Product distributions show that the umbrella mode is strongly coupled to the C–Cl stretching mode and cannot be treated as a spectator mode. The reaction probability rises almost linearly with increasing initial excitation of the umbrella bending mode. The effect with respect to the C–Cl stretch is five times larger for more than two quanta in this mode, and in agreement with previous work saturation is found. Exciting the high-frequency C–H stretching mode, (1,0,0), yields a large increase for small energies [more than two orders of magnitude larger than (0,0,0)], while for translational energies higher than 2000 cm−1, it becomes a pure spectator mode. For combined initial excitations including the symmetric C–H stretch, the spectator character of the latter is even more pronounced. However, up to more than 1500 cm−1 translational energy, the C–H vibration does not behave adiabatically during the course of reaction, because only 20\% of the initial energy is found in the same mode of the product molecule. The distribution of resonance widths and peak heights is discussed, and it is found that individual resonances pertinent to intermediate complexes Cl−⋯CH3Cl show product distributions independent of the initial vibrational state of the reactant molecule. The relatively high reactivity, of resonance states with respect to excitation of any mode, found in previous work is confirmed in the present calculations. However, reactivity of intermediate states and reactivity with respect to initial vibrational excitation have to be distinguished. There is a strong mixing between the vibrational states reflected in numerous avoided crossings of the hyperspherical adiabatic curves. {\copyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics.}},

General expressions for any type of reaction path are presented with special interest in the intrinsic reaction coordinate, which have been used to study selected cases, including a one-dimensional Eckart barrier, for which results are shown to be exact, two bidimensional systems, namely, a M\"{u}ller–Brown potential energy surface, which is characteristic of polyatomic isomerization processes, and the collinear H+H2 chemical reaction, and finally the tridimensional, J = 0, F+H2 reaction. Results for the specific chemical systems are shown to be in quite good agreement with exact two- and three-dimensional quantum calculations concerning autocorrelation functions as well as transmission factors as a function of total energy.}},

    abstract = {{Direct comparisons of the reactivity and mechanistic pathways for anionic systems in the gas phase and in solution are presented. Rate constants and kinetic isotope effects for the reactions of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and tert-butyl iodide with cyanide ion in the gas phase, as well as for the reactions of methyl and ethyl iodide with cyanide ion in several solvents, are reported. In addition to measuring the perdeutero kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for each reaction, the secondary α- and ?-deuterium KIEs were determined for the ethyl iodide reaction. Comparisons of experimental results with computational transition states, KIEs, and branching fractions are explored to determine how solvent affects these reactions. The KIEs show that the transition state does not change significantly when the solvent is changed from dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (a protic solvent) to dimethyl sulfoxide (a strongly polar aprotic solvent) to tetrahydrofuran (a slightly polar aprotic solvent) in the ethyl iodide?cyanide ion SN2 reaction in solution, as the ?Solvation Rule for SN2 Reactions? predicts. However, the Solvation Rule fails the ultimate test of predicting gas phase results, where significantly smaller (more inverse) KIEs indicate the existence of a tighter transition state. This result is primarily attributed to the greater electrostatic forces between the partial negative charges on the iodide and cyanide ions and the partial positive charge on the α carbon in the gas phase transition state. Nevertheless, in evaluating the competition between SN2 and E2 processes, the mechanistic results for the solution and gas phase reactions are strikingly similar. The reaction of cyanide ion with ethyl iodide occurs exclusively by an SN2 mechanism in solution and primarily by an SN2 mechanism in the gas phase; only ?1\% of the gas phase reaction is ascribed to an elimination process.}},

    abstract = {{We propose large-core correlation-consistent (cc) pseudopotential basis sets for the heavy p-block elements Ga–Kr and In–Xe. The basis sets are of cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ quality, and have been optimized for use with the large-core (valence-electrons only) Stuttgart–Dresden–Bonn (SDB) relativistic pseudopotentials. Validation calculations on a variety of third-row and fourth-row diatomics suggest them to be comparable in quality to the all-electron cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets for lighter elements. Especially the SDB-cc-pVQZ basis set in conjunction with a core polarization potential (CPP) yields excellent agreement with experiment for compounds of the later heavy p-block elements. For accurate calculations on Ga (and, to a lesser extent, Ge) compounds, explicit treatment of 13 valence electrons appears to be desirable, while it seems inevitable for In compounds. For Ga and Ge, we propose correlation consistent basis sets extended for (3d) correlation. For accurate calculations on organometallic complexes of interest to homogenous catalysis, we recommend a combination of the standard cc-pVTZ basis set for first- and second-row elements, the presently derived SDB-cc-pVTZ basis set for heavier p-block elements, and for transition metals, the small-core [6s5p3d] Stuttgart–Dresden basis set-relativistic effective core potential combination supplemented by (2f1g) functions with exponents given in the Appendix to the present paper. {\copyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics.}},

The equations for the dynamics are first analysed in the Lamb–Dicke regime (i.e. when the size of the mechanical wavefunction is much smaller than the laser wavelength), and then in general, for Doppler cooling. In the latter case, using several consecutive steps of averaging we derive from the full quantum mechanical master equation an equation for the total mechanical energy of the one-dimensional crystal, defined on a coarse-grained energy scale whose grid size is smaller than the linewidth of the electronic transition. This equation describes the cooling dynamics for an arbitrary number of ions in the quantum regime. We discuss the analogy and the scalability of the string's laser-cooling dynamics with that of a single trapped ion.}},

@article{Werner88,
    abstract = {{The interaction potential energy surfaces for CN(X 2∑+, A 2∏)+He have been computed from ab initio MCSCF and MCSCF‐CI wave functions using an extensive basis set. In the presence of the He atom the two degenerate components of the CN 2∏ state split into wave functions of A′ and A″ symmetry, and the symmetry of the 2∑+ state reduces to A′. The two adiabatic potentials for the A′ states are transformed to a diabatic basis, which yields a fourth potential energy surface V1, describing the collision‐induced electrostatic coupling between the two A′ states. The degree of mixing of the two diabatic A′ states has been determined by integration of the relevant nonadiabtic coupling matrix elements and, in a simpler method, from the coefficients of the MCSCF configurations. Both procedures yield virtually identical results. The nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements are strongly peaked near the CN bond distance at which the X 2∑+ and A 2∏ states cross in the isolated molecule. The diabatic coupling potential V1, however, is only weakly dependent on the CN bond distance, and decreases exponentially with the CN–He separation. Near the classical turning points for room temperature collisions the magnitude of V1 is approximately 50 cm−1. The V1 potential shows a bimodal character as a function of the collision angle θ. These results are discussed in connection with recent experiments of Dagdigian and co‐workers.}},

@article{crisp91,
    abstract = {{The interaction of a nonrelativistic, ''two-level'' atom with a single-frequency, quantized electromagnetic field is usually analyzed in the dipole approximation by applying the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) to obtain the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In this paper, it is shown that for a spin-1/2 particle, at rest in a constant magnetic field and for a system that obeys the electric dipole Δm=±1 selection rules, a choice of a perturbing field that consists of circularly polarized photons can make the RWA unnecessary for the solution of the quantum-electrodynamic (QED) problem. For these cases, the only approximation necessary to obtain an exact solution of the QED problem is to neglect the spontaneous emission of photons with a sense of polarization opposite that of the perturbing field. The matrix elements corresponding to these ''virtual'' processes are independent of the number of photons n in the applied field and become relatively small, compared with those that correspond to energy-conserving processes, as n becomes large.However, a two-level system that obeys the Δm=0 selection rule will require the RWA in order to reduce it to the JCM, regardless of the choice of polarization of the perturbing field. For this case, the emission of the photons that do not conserve energy is an induced process that corresponds to matrix elements that increase as √n+1 . It is thus concluded that, provided the right choice of selection rules and polarization of the applied field is made, the JCM provides a more accurate description of some systems than the accuracy of the RWA. Furthermore, it is concluded that an experimental test of the validity of the RWA can be made by performing the same experiments on an electric dipole Δm=±1 transition, first with circularly polarized light and then with linearly polarized light of the same intensity. Any difference in response of the atomic system for these two experiments can be identified with terms that are neglected in the RWA. This experimental technique may prove useful for observing the optical Bloch-Siegert shift and for investigating the failure of the RWA and the chaotic quantum behavior predicted by Milonni, Ackerhalt, and Galbraith [Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 966 (1983)].}},

@article{Shore93,
    abstract = {{Abstract The Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), a soluble fully quantum mechanical model of an atom in a field, was first used (in 1963) to examine the classical aspects of spontaneous emission and to reveal the existence of Rabi oscillations in atomic excitation probabilities for fields with sharply defined energy (or photon number). For fields having a statistical distributions of photon numbers the oscillations collapse to an expected steady value. In 1980 it was discovered that with appropriate initial conditions (e.g. a near-classical field), the Rabi oscillations would eventually revive, only to collapse and revive repeatedly in a complicated pattern. The existence of these revivals, present in the analytic solutions of the JCM, provided direct evidence for discreteness of field excitation (photons) and hence for the truly quantum nature of radiation. Subsequent study revealed further non-classical properties of the JCM field, such as a tendency of the photons to antibunch. Within the last two years it has been found that during the quiescent intervals of collapsed Rabi oscillations the atom and field exist in a macroscopic superposition state (a Schr\"{o}dinger cat). This discovery offers the opportunity to use the JCM to elucidate the basic properties of quantum correlation (entanglement) and to explore still further the relationship between classical and quantum physics. The relative simplicity of the JCM and the ease with which it can be extended through analytic expressions or numerical computation continues to motivate attention, as evidenced by the growing abundance of publications. We here present an overview of the theory of the JCM and some of the many extensions and generalizations that have appeared.}},

@article{Jaynes63,
    abstract = {{This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h Ω to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the - oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.}},

@article{Nienhuis91,
    abstract = {{We give a general theoretical description of radiative forces on atoms in a monochromatic radiation field. The driven transition has a lower level consisting of several substates, and we consider the limit of low velocities and weak intensities. This situation comprises the schemes where cooling to temperatures below the Doppler limit is possible. After expressing the atomic dipole in terms of the polarizability tensor, we obtain an expression of the force as the sum of the radiation pressure, the dipole force, and a contribution from the gradient of the polarization. This latter contribution contains a part resulting from redistribution of photons between the plane waves that compose the field, and a part resulting from fluorescence. We express the average force and the momentum-diffusion tensor in terms of a closed evolution equation for the lower-state density matrix. We show by a scaling argument that in any case of cooling, the final temperature goes down linearly with the intensity, until the recoil limit is approached. The description is valid for a weak and monochromatic, but otherwise arbitrary field, and it allows for the presence of an external magnetic field, and of hyperfine splitting. It is applicable to cooling in one, two, or three dimensions. We give numerical results for the average force in a number of specific cases of two counterrunning plane waves.}},

@book{Schleich,
    abstract = {{Quantum Optics in Phase Space provides a concise introduction to the rapidly
moving field of quantum optics from the point of view of phase space. Modern
in style and didactically skillful, Quantum Optics in Phase Space prepares
students for their own research by presenting detailed derivations, many
illustrations and a large set of workable problems at the end of each chapter.
Often, the theoretical treatments are accompanied by the corresponding
experiments. An exhaustive list of references provides a guide to the
literature. Quantum Optics in Phase Space also serves advanced researchers as
a comprehensive reference book.


Starting with an extensive review of the experiments that define quantum
optics and a brief summary of the foundations of quantum mechanics the author
Wolfgang P. Schleich illustrates the properties of quantum states with the
help of the Wigner phase space distribution function. His description of waves
ala WKB connects semi-classical phase space with the Berry phase. These semi-
classical techniques provide deeper insight into the timely topics of wave
packet dynamics, fractional revivals and the Talbot effect.


Whereas the first half of the book deals with mechanical oscillators such as
ions in a trap or atoms in a standing wave the second half addresses problems
where the quantization of the radiation field is of importance. Such topics
extensively discussed include optical interferometry, the atom-field
interaction, quantum state preparation and measurement, entanglement,
decoherence, the one-atom maser and atom optics in quantized light fields.


Quantum Optics in Phase Space presents the subject of quantum optics as
transparently as possible. Giving wide-ranging references, it enables students
to study and solve problems with modern scientific literature. The result is a
remarkably concise yet comprehensive and accessible text- and reference book -
an inspiring source of information and insight for students, teachers and
researchers alike.}},

    abstract = {{This work theoretically addresses the trapping of an ionized atom with a single valence electron by means of lasers, analyzing qualitatively and quantitatively the consequences of the net charge of the particle. In our model, the coupling between the ion and the electromagnetic field includes the charge monopole and the internal dipole, within a multipolar expansion of the interaction Hamiltonian. Specifically, we perform a Power–Zienau–Woolley transformation, taking into account the motion of the center of mass. The net charge produces a correction in the atomic dipole that is of order  m e / M , with  m e  the electron mass and  M  the total mass of the ion. With respect to neutral atoms, there is also an extra coupling to the laser field that can be approximated by that of the monopole located at the position of the center of mass. These additional effects, however, are shown to be very small compared to the dominant dipolar trapping term.}},

concerned with temporal behaviour rather than with the characteristic energy
levels of the stationary status of atoms. In Volume 2, Part IV a variety of
multi-state extensions of the simple two-state atom, beginning with three-
state models and continuing to finite and infinite chains of excitation are
examined. Part V presents and applies the theory of angular momentum to
coherent excitation. The final part examines a number of extensions of

applications to the fluctuations that inevitably accompany excitation and act
to destroy coherence. A set of appendices summarize background material.}},

    abstract = {{Electrons and their dynamics are involved in bond breaking and formation; thus, the idea to steer chemical reactions by localization of electronic wavepackets seems natural. The formation of a localized electronic wavepacket requires the superposition of two or more appropriate electronic states through, e.g., an external electric field. The guiding of such an electronic wavepacket is only possible within the coherence time of the system. In theoretical studies, we elucidate the role of electron wavepacket motion for the control of molecular processes. We analyze three examples of electron wavepacket-driven processes with direct connection to already performed or ongoing experiments. From these examples, we extract the system requirements defining the time window for intramolecular electronic coherence and efficient control. With this knowledge, we derived an appropriate molecular configuration in a photoreaction of a polyatomic molecule where a control by guiding electronic wavepackets is possible. For such a photoreaction, we designed a new control scheme with the carrier envelope phase as a control parameter that works at high efficiency.}},

In particular, we use a rate-equation approach to simulate cooling of SiO+, in which population buildup in the intermediate state is prevented by its short lifetime. We determine that Doppler cooling of SiO+ can be accomplished without optically repumping from the intermediate state, at the cost of causing undesirable parity flips and rotational diffusion. Since the necessary repumping would require a large number of continuous-wave lasers, optical pulse shaping of a femtosecond laser is proposed as an attractive alternative. Other candidate three-electron-level molecules are also discussed.}},

The purpose is to study the possibility of single molecule control of the products in the presence of two laser fields. The system evolves on four electronic potential-energy curves, X1  , A1  , B1  , and C1  . These potential-energy curves are calculated from first principles using multireference self-consistent field theory. The accuracy of the electronic potential curves has been checked by calculating the energies of the rovibrational eigenstates and comparing them to experimental findings. The photodissociation dynamics has furthermore been simulated by solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation. It is shown that the branching ratio of the two dissociation channels, Mg++H or Mg+H+, can be controlled by changing the intensity and wavelength of the two driving laser fields.}},

We present a theoretical study where shaped laser pulses are utilized to prefer specific bonds in a mixture of more than one carbonyl reactant. A mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone has been chosen as a representative example. The light pulse is supposed to provide the activation energy and to adopt the function of a protecting group. The control aim is to stretch exclusively the C-O bond of one compound to the length required in the Grignard transition state. To guarantee an experimentally realizable bandwidth for the unshaped pulse, we use our recently developed optimal control theory algorithm, which allows the simultaneous optimization of the light field in the time and frequency domain. Highly selective picosecond control pulses could be optimized in the infrared regime suggesting that laser assisted chemoselectivity is possible to a large extent. To obtain control not only on the final product but also on the excitation mechanism, various initial conditions and frequency restrictions were investigated.}},

We assume that the cavity loss rate is much larger than the atom-cavity coupling (bad-cavity limit) and that the atomic excited state is weakly occupied (low saturation limit). After elimination of the cavity mode and the atomic excited state, we derive rate equations for the populations of the trap states. We find that in the Lamb-Dicke limit the atom can be cooled to the ground state of the trap even in the strong confinement limit.

In this Review, the progress in the quantum mechanical treatment of SN2 reactions in the gas phase is reviewed. The potential energy profile of this class of reactions is characterized by two relatively deep wells, which correspond to pre- and post-reaction charge–dipole complexes. As a consequence, the complex-forming reaction is dominated by Feshbach resonances. Calculations in the energetic continuum constitute a major challenge because the high density of resonance states imposes considerable requirements on the convergence and the energetic resolution of the scattering data. However, the effort is rewarding because new insights into the details of multimode quantum dynamics of elementary chemical reactions can be obtained.}},

In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modified, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of field-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical fields in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.}},

@article{citeulike:7500031,
    abstract = {{Quantum control is concerned with active manipulation of physical and chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early developments to the most recent advances. Among numerous theoretical insights and technological improvements that produced the present state-of-the-art in quantum control, there have been several breakthroughs of foremost importance. On the technology side, the current experimental successes would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser sources and pulse shapers. On the theory side, the two most critical insights were (i) realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via manipulation of quantum interferences and (ii) understanding that optimally shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial concept of adaptive feedback control (AFC), which is a laboratory procedure employing measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the desired objective. Optimization in AFC experiments is guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be especially effective. AFC of quantum phenomena has found numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of theoretical control designs in experimental realizations and real-time quantum feedback control. The paper concludes with a perspective of open research directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.}},

@article{Brinks10,
    abstract = {{The active steering of the pathways taken by chemical reactions and the optimization of energy conversion processes1, 2, 3 provide striking examples of the coherent control of quantum interference through the use of shaped laser pulses. Experimentally, coherence is usually established by synchronizing a subset of molecules in an ensemble4, 5, 6, 7 with ultra-short laser pulses8. But in complex systems where even chemically identical molecules exist with different conformations and in diverse environments, the synchronized subset will have an intrinsic inhomogeneity that limits the degree of coherent control that can be achieved. A natural—and, indeed, the ultimate—solution to overcoming intrinsic inhomogeneities is the investigation of the behaviour of one molecule at a time. The single-molecule approach9, 10 has provided useful insights into phenomena as diverse as biomolecular interactions11, 12, 13, cellular processes14 and the dynamics of supercooled liquids15 and conjugated polymers16. Coherent state preparation of single molecules has so far been restricted to cryogenic conditions17, whereas at room temperature only incoherent vibrational relaxation pathways have been probed18. Here we report the observation and manipulation of vibrational wave-packet interference in individual molecules at ambient conditions. We show that adapting the time and phase distribution of the optical excitation field to the dynamics of each molecule results in a high degree of control, and expect that the approach can be extended to achieve single-molecule coherent control in other complex inhomogeneous systems.}},

As qubit system we use vibrational modes of polyatomic molecules, here the two IR-active modes of acetylene.

To correct for this unwanted behavior we include pressure on the quantum phase in our multitarget approach. In addition the accuracy of these phase corrected global quantum gates is enhanced. Furthermore we could show that in our molecular approach phase corrected quantum gates and basis set independence are directly linked. Basis set independence is also another property highly required for the performance of quantum algorithms.

Optical pumping into a single vibrational level is accomplished with an incoherent light source by eliminating transitions from the targeted vibrational level. The broadband spectrum of the laser is wide enough to electronically excite several vibrational states of the molecule simultaneously.

First; we solve the time evolution of the wave packet using the traditional master equation giving directly the ensemble averages. Second; we use the recently developed Monte Carlo simulation method; which gives the individual members of an ensemble of quantum states undergoing spontaneous quantum jumps.

    abstract = {{A novel discrete variable representation (DVR) is introduced for use as the L2 basis of the S‐matrix version of the Kohn variational method [Zhang, Chu, and Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 88, 6233 (1988)] for quantum reactive scattering. (It can also be readily used for quantum eigenvalue problems.) The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal, as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ''universal,'' i.e., independent of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions; it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H+H2→H2+H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities is achieved with only about 15\% more DVR grid points than the number of conventional basis functions used in previous S‐matrix Kohn calculations. Test calculations for the collinear Cl+HCl→ClH+Cl reaction shows that the unusual dynamical features of heavy+light‐heavy reactions are also well described by this approach. Since DVR approaches avoid having to evaluate integrals in order to obtain the Hamiltonian matrix and since a DVR Hamiltonian matrix is extremely sparse, this DVR version of the S‐matrix Kohn approach should make it possible to deal with more complex chemical reactions than heretofore possible.}},

Central barrier heights (Hcent) for reaction in the exothermic direction vary from 0.8 kJ mol-1 for Y = F, X = I up to 39.5 kJ mol-1 for Y = Cl, X = Br (at 0 K), and are in most cases significantly lower than those for the set of identity SN2 reactions X- + CH3X XCH3 + X- (X = F-I). Overall barriers (Hovr) for reaction in the exothermic direction are all negative (varying from -68.9 kJ mol-1 for Y = F, X = I to -2.3 kJ mol-1 for Y = Br, X = I), in contrast to the overall barriers for the identity reactions where only the value for X = F is negative. Complexation enthalpies (Hcomp) of the ion-molecule complexes Y-···CH3X vary from 30.4 kJ mol-1 for Y = F, X = I to 69.6 kJ mol-1 for Y = I, X = F (at 298 K), in good agreement with experimental and earlier computational studies. Complexation enthalpies in the reaction series Y- + CH3X (Y = F-I, X = F, Cl, Br, I) are found to exhibit good linear correlations with halogen electronegativity. Both the central barriers and the overall barriers show good linear correlations with reaction exothermicity, indicating a rate-equilibrium relationship in the Y- + CH3X reaction set. The data for the central barriers show good agreement with the predictions of the Marcus equation, though modifications of the Marcus equation that consider overall barriers are found to be less satisfactory. Further interesting features of the non-identity reaction set are the good correlations between the central barriers and the geometric looseness (\%L), geometric asymmetry (\%AS), charge asymmetry (q(X-Y)), and bond asymmetry (WBI) of the transition structures.}},

    abstract = {{Rayleigh scattering is a powerful diagnostic tool for the study of gases and is particularly useful for aiding in the understanding of complex flow fields and combustion phenomena. Although the mechanism associated with the scattering, induced electric dipole radiation, is conceptually straightforward, the features of the scattering are complex because of the anisotropy of molecules, collective scattering from many molecules and inelastic scattering associated with rotational and vibrational transitions. These effects cause the scattered signal to be depolarized and to have spectral features that reflect the pressure, temperature and internal energy states of the gas. The very small scattering cross section makes molecular Rayleigh scattering particularly susceptible to background interference. Scattering from very small particles also falls into the Rayleigh range and may dominate the scattering from molecules if the particle density is high. This particle scattering can be used to enhance flow visualization and velocity measurements, or it may be removed by spectral filtering. New approaches to spectral filtering are now being applied to both Rayleigh molecular scattering and Rayleigh particle scattering to extract quantitative information about complex gas flow fields. This paper outlines the classical properties of Rayleigh scattering and reviews some of the new advances in flow field imaging that have been achieved using the new filter approaches.}},

    abstract = {{Optimal control theory is developed for the task of obtaining an objective in a subspace of the Hilbert space while avoiding population transfer to other subspaces. The objective, a state-to-state transition or a unitary transformation, is carried out without loss of coherence, provided the system in the allowed subspace is decoupled from its environment. An optimization functional is introduced that leads to monotonic convergence of the algorithm. This approach becomes necessary for molecular systems which are subject to processes implying loss of coherence such as ionization or predissociation. In the subspaces corresponding to lossy channels, controllability is hampered or even completely lost. A functional constraint that depends on the state of the system at each instant in time keeps the system out of the lossy channels. We outline the resulting algorithm and discuss its convergence properties. The functionality of the algorithm is demonstrated for the examples of a state-to-state transition and of a unitary transformation for a model of cold Rb2.}},

Overall gas-phase barrier heights do not show a strong variation with halogen atom and are calculated to be 184.5 (X = F), 193.8 (X = Cl), 178.9 (X = Br), and 171.4 kJ mol-1 (X = I), substantially higher than the corresponding barriers for back-side attack (-8.0 for X = F, 11.5 for X = Cl, 5.8 for X = Br, and 6.5 kJ mol-1 for X = I). The difference between the overall barrier for back-side attack and front-side attack is smallest for X = I (164.9 kJ mol-1). Central barrier heights for front-side attack decrease in the following order: 241.0 (X = F), 237.8 (X = Cl), 220.0 (X = Br), and 207.4 kJ mol-1 (X = I). The minimum energy pathways for both back-side and front-side SN2 reactions are found to involve the same ion-molecule complex (X-···H3CX), with the front-side pathway becoming feasible at higher energies. Indeed, our results suggest that the chloride exchange in CH3Cl, which has been found in gas-phase experiments at high energies, may be the first example of a front-side SN2 reaction with retention of configuration at saturated carbon. Analysis of our computational data in terms of frontier orbital theory suggests that elongation of the bond between the central atom and X could be a significant factor in decreasing the unfavorable nature of the front-side SN2 reaction with retention of configuration in going from X = F to X = I. Ion-molecule complexes CH3-X···X-, which may be pre-reaction complexes in direct collinear halophilic attack, were found for X = Br and I but not for X = F and Cl. The calculated complexation energies (Hcomp) for halophilic complexes are considerably smaller (7.3 and 19.4 kJ mol-1 for X = Br and I, respectively) than those for the corresponding pre-reaction complexes for SN2 attack at carbon (41.1 and 36.0 kJ mol-1 for X = Br and I, respectively). Nucleophilic substitution reactions at the halogen atom in CH3X (X = F-I) (halophilic reactions) are highly endothermic and appear to represent an unlikely mechanistic pathway for identity halide exchange.}},

The use of an optical cavity to enhance coherent Rayleigh scattering into a decaying cavity mode has been suggested as a potential method to mitigate Raman loss, thereby enabling the laser cooling of molecules to ultracold temperatures. We discuss the possibility of cavity-assisted laser cooling of particles without closed transitions, identify conditions necessary to achieve efficient cooling, and suggest solutions given experimental constraints. Specifically, it is shown that cooperativities much greater than unity are required for cooling without loss, and that this could be achieved via the superradiant scattering associated with intracavity self-localization of the molecules. Particular emphasis is given to the polar hydroxyl radical (OH), cold samples of which are readily obtained from Stark deceleration.}},

Particularly good agreement is found for fundamental vibrational frequencies obtained by combining configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) harmonic frequencies with SCF anharmonic corrections within the same basis set. This work also provides insight into the applicability of standard spectroscopic perturbation theory to such molecules. Moreover, the methods used here are immediately applicable to molecules significantly larger than those studied here.}},

    abstract = {{We show that the dressed-atom approach provides a quantitative understanding of the main features of radiative dipole forces (mean value, fluctuations, velocity dependence) in the high-intensity limit where perturbative treatments are no longer valid. In an inhomogeneous laser beam, the energies of the dressed states vary in space, and this gives rise to dressed-state-dependent forces. Spontaneous transitions between dressed states lead to a multivalued instantaneous force fluctuating around a mean value. The velocity dependence of the mean force is related to the modification, induced by the atomic motion, of the population balance between the different dressed states. The corresponding modification of the atomic energy is associated with a change of the fluorescence spectrum emitted by the atom. The particular case of atomic motion in a standing wave is investigated, and two regimes are identified in which the mean dipole force averaged over a wavelength exhibits a simple velocity dependence. The large values of this force achievable with reasonable laser powers are pointed out with view to slowing down atoms with dipole forces.}},

The manipulation of light–matter interactions at the single-atom and single-photon level can be achieved in cavity quantum electrodynamics, in particular in the regime of strong coupling in which atom and cavity form a single entity. In the optical domain, this requires a single atom at rest inside a microcavity. Here we show that an orthogonal arrangement of a cooling laser, trapping laser and cavity vacuum gives rise to a unique combination of friction forces that act along all three directions. This combination of cooling forces is applied to catch and cool a single atom in a high-finesse cavity. The high cooling efficiency leads to a low temperature and an average single-atom trapping time of 17 s, during which the strongly coupled atom can be observed continuously.}},

In principle, the quantum system can be steered towards a desired state by its interaction with light. For example, in photoinduced transitions between atomic energy levels, quantum interference effects can lead to enhancement or cancellation of the total transition probability. The interference depends on the spectral phase distribution of the incident beam; as this phase distribution can be tuned, the outcome of the interaction can in principle be controlled. Here we demonstrate that a femtosecond laser pulse can be tailored, using ultrashort pulse-shaping4, 5, 6, 7 techniques, to control two-photon transitions in caesium. By varying the spectral phases of the pulse components, we observe the predicted cancellation of the transitions due to destructive quantum interference; the power spectrum and energy of these 'dark pulses' are unchanged. We also show that the pulse shape can be modified extensively without affecting the two-photon transition probability.}},

    abstract = {{In recent experiments on ultracold matter, molecules have been produced from ultracold atoms by photoassociation, Feshbach resonances, and three-body recombination. The created molecules are translationally cold, but vibrationally highly excited. This will eventually lead them to be lost from the trap due to collisions. We propose shaped laser pulses to transfer these highly excited molecules to their ground vibrational level. Optimal control theory is employed to find the light field that will carry out this task with minimum intensity. We present results for the sodium dimer. The final target can be reached to within 99\% provided the initial guess field is physically motivated. We find that the optimal fields contain the transition frequencies required by a good Franck-Condon pumping scheme. The analysis identifies the ranges of intensity and pulse duration which are able to achieve this task before any other competing processes take place. Such a scheme could produce stable ultracold molecular samples or even stable molecular Bose-Einstein condensates.}},

    abstract = {{Recent progress in both theoretical and experimental methods has led to the widespread belief that control of chemical reactions with ultrashort laser pulses is in principle achievable. In this article, the I2 molecule, which has been the subject of a great deal of femtosecond work, is studied theoretically as a prospect for experimental control. An unconstrained optimization of the electric field is performed, with the objective of dissociation on the B state. Krotov's optimization theory is used for this unconstrained optimization, which reduces the CPU time usage by a factor of four. The field which results from the optimization yields a probability of 99\% for B state dissociation. The Husimi transform of the optimal field indicates a simple underlying structure, in contrast with many previous fields obtained by optimal control theory: the optimal field closely resembles a sequence of three Gaussian pulses with the same central frequency. Analysis of the optimal field indicates it operates by a quasi-cw excitation directly into the B continuum. A constrained optimization was then performed: the electric field was restricted onto the frequency interval from 0 to 19752 cm-1 to avoid the quasi-continuous-wave excitation mechanism. The optimal solution of this problem uses a three-photon pump--dump--pump (PDP) mechanism. The optimal field was approximated by sequences of three and four Gaussian-shaped laser pulses; the optimal and the two approximating fields gave 34\%, 6\% and 11\% for the dissociation probability, respectively. The fields from the constrained optimization have fwhm on the order of 30-50 fs and intensities in the range of 1010 W/cm2 and should be experimentally producible with available technology.}},

Krotov; Automation and Remote Control  60 ; 1427 (1999)]; we extend the capabilities of optimal control theory to the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE). The paper begins with a general review of the Krotov approach to optimization. Although the linearized version of the method is sufficient for the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation; the full flexibility of the general method is required for treatment of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Formal equations for the optimization of the NLSE; as well as a concrete algorithm are presented. As an illustration; we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) initially at rest in a harmonic trap. A phase develops across the BEC when an optical lattice potential is turned on. The goal is to counter this effect and keep the phase flat by adjusting the trap strength. The problem is formulated in the language of optimal control theory (OCT) and solved using the above methodology. To our knowledge; this is the first rigorous application of OCT to the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation; a capability that is bound to have numerous other applications.}},

Applied to coordinate systems other than cartesian this usually leads to incorrect results. The difficulty is here traced partially to the way in which ψξ is normalized and partly to the choice of H. In H expressions such as qpq-1p and p2 are not equivalent, and the simplified form is generally incorrect. A formula satisfying all the requirements of quantum mechanics for a Hamiltonian of a conservative system, in an arbitrary coordinate system, is therefore developed H=1/2μΣr=1r=nΣs=1s=ng-1/4prg1/2grspsg-1/4+U This formula is applied to a case of plane polar coordinates and leads to correct results.}},

Ritsch, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 253003 (2002)] and observed experimentally [A. T. Black et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 203001 (2003)]. Above a threshold in the driving laser intensity, from a uniform distribution the atoms evolve into one of two stable patterns that produce superradiant scattering into the cavity. We derive analytic formulas for the threshold and critical exponent of this phase transition from a mean-field approach. Numerical simulations of the microscopic dynamics reveal that, on a laboratory time scale, a hysteresis masks the mean-field behavior. Simple physical arguments explain this phenomenon and provide analytical expressions for the observable threshold. Above a certain density of the atoms a limited number of "defects" appear in the organized phase and influence the statistical properties of the system. The scaling of the cavity cooling mechanism and the phase-space density with the atom number is also studied.}},

    abstract = {{A derivation of the vibrational Hamiltonian in generalized (internal) coordinates within a grid representation using the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) method is presented. The objective of the theory is to make possible the solution of vibrational problems in two or more dimensions in terms of internal coordinates. These coordinates are often the ones of choice when the vibrations of interest are localized or when only selected coordinates are considered in a larger system. As in the case of the original FGH method, the matrix elements are easy to evaluate in a fast and robust manner. The method is tested on two different molecular systems, FHF- and picolinic acid N-oxide, both containing strong hydrogen bonds. The illustrative problems are two-dimensional and are highly anharmonic. The importance of both the coupling terms, as well as the variable reduced masses, required by the formulation of the Hamiltonian in generalized coordinates, are examined, and the formalism is shown to be robust in that identical results are obtained using different sets of internal coordinates applied to the same physical problem. Good agreement between calculated and observed vibrational frequencies is also obtained.}},

    abstract = {{A general expression for the semiclassical, nonrelativistic linear polarizability of an arbitrary volume element V has been derived in the long wavelength approximation. The derivation starts from the expectation value of the dipole strength, as in the original Kramers-Heisenberg paper about optical scattering by atoms. The main requirements underlying the present approach are a separate non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian and a frequency dependent damping, which is zero for the static case. Resonant and antiresonant exponentials are both found to be necessary to obtain a proper static response. It is concluded that even parity for the damping has to be preferred from the theoretical point of view, although odd and asymmetric parity yield virtually the same polarizability. The electromagnetic response can still be written in terms of a single complex frequency, in agreement with the requirements of electrodynamics. The resulting expression is suited for the treatment of nonisotropic systems.}},

The trapping condition is that the instantaneous phase of the laser is locked to the phase of the transition dipole moment of v=0 with the excited population. The molecules that reach v=0 by spontaneous emission are then trapped, while the others are continually repumped.

The methodology, originally developed for the first row atoms [T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 90, (1989)] is first applied to sulfur. The exponents for the polarization functions (dfgh) are systematically optimized for a correlated wave function (HF+1+2). The (sp) correlation functions are taken from the appropriate HF primitive sets; it is shown that these functions differ little from the optimum functions. Basis sets of double zeta [4s3p1d], triple zeta [5s4p2d1f], and quadruple zeta [6s5p3d2f1g] quality are defined. Each of these sets is then augmented with diffuse functions to better describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and p functions were obtained by optimization for the anion HF energy, while an additional polarization function for each symmetry present in the standard set was optimized for the anion HF+1+2 energy. The results for sulfur are then used to assist in determining double zeta, triple zeta, and quadruple zeta basis sets for the remainder of the second row of the p block.

@article{Dunning89,
    abstract = {{In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Alml\"{o}f, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml\"{o}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.

At present the main application is laser cooling; but the approach is applicable to a broader range of phenomena. It is based on an adiabatic elimination philosophy; which turns out to give the lowest-order quantum corrections to the behavior found when the photon momentum goes to zero. Hence it is called a semiclassical theory. In this manner a subjective but consistent approach can be presented; other treatments are incorporated or mentioned at the appropriate places. Both the classical and the quantum-mechanical approach are discussed. Those readers who wish to obtain only a heuristic overview of the phenomena can concentrate on Sec. III; which treats both the photon momentum effects and their connection with photon counting statistics. The detailed theoretical treatment utilizes Wigner functions and Fokker-Planck techniques. The ensuing theory is applied both to the cooling of free particles and trapped ones. The paper ends with an extensive bibliography; where the author lists most papers of interest for research into the mechanical manifestations of light. For completeness; many papers are included that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.}},

    abstract = {{We review the modifications and implications of the effect of light forces on atoms when the field is enclosed in an optical resonator of high finesse. The systems considered range from a single atom strongly coupled to a single mode of a high-Q microcavity to a large ensemble of atoms in a highly degenerate quasi-confocal resonator. We set up general models that allow us to obtain analytic expressions for the optical potential, friction, and diffusion. In the bad-cavity limit the modified cooling properties can be attributed to the spectral modifications of light absorption and spontaneous emission in a form of generalized and enhanced Doppler cooling. For the strong coupling regime in a good cavity, we identify the dynamical coupling between the light field intensity and the atomic motion as the central mechanism underlying the cavity-induced cooling. The dynamical cavity cooling, which does not rely on spontaneous emission, can be enhanced by multimode cavity geometries because of the effect of coherent photon redistribution between different modes. The model is then generalized to include several distinct frequencies to account for more general trap geometries. Finally we show that the field-induced buildup of correlations between the motion of different particles plays a central role in the scaling behavior of the system. Depending on the geometry and parameters, its effect ranges from strong destructive interference, slowing down the cooling process, to self-organized crystallization, implying atomic self-trapping and faster cooling to lower temperatures by cooperative coherent scattering.}},

The creation of a pulse containing 103\&\#150;106 molecules possessing a longitudinal velocity spread from 2 to 80\&nbsp;\&nbsp;m/s around a mean laboratory velocity variable from 550\&nbsp;\&nbsp;m/s to rest with only a few mm spatial extent represents an exciting and useful experimental capability for exploring free-radical dynamics.}},

Spontaneous emission in a random direction provides the dissipative mechanism required to remove entropy from the atom. However, alternative cooling methods have been proposed1, 2 for a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity; the role of spontaneous emission is replaced by the escape of a photon from the cavity. Application of such cooling schemes would improve the performance of atom–cavity systems for quantum information processing3, 4. Furthermore, as cavity cooling does not rely on spontaneous emission, it can be applied to systems that cannot be laser-cooled by conventional methods; these include molecules2 (which do not have a closed transition) and collective excitations of Bose condensates5, which are destroyed by randomly directed recoil kicks. Here we demonstrate cavity cooling of single rubidium atoms stored in an intracavity dipole trap. The cooling mechanism results in extended storage times and improved localization of atoms. We estimate that the observed cooling rate is at least five times larger than that produced by free-space cooling methods, for comparable excitation of the atom.}},

@article{Tannor99,
    abstract = {{Optimal control theory (OCT) is applied to the problem of cooling molecular rotations. The optimal field gives rise to a striking behavior, in which there is no noticeable increase in the lowest rotational state population until the last percent or so of the control interval, at which point the population jumps to 1. Further analysis of the intermediate time interval reveals that cooling is taking place all along, in the sense that the purity of the system, as measured by Tr(rho2), is increasing monotonically in time. Once the system becomes almost completely pure, the external control field can transfer the amplitude to the lowest rotational state by a completely Hamiltonian manipulation. This mechanism is interesting because it suggests a possible way of accelerating cooling, by exploiting the cooling induced by spontaneous emission to all the ground electronic state levels, not just the lowest rotational level. However, it also raises a major paradox: it may be shown that external control fields, no matter how complicated, cannot change the value of Tr(rho2); changing this quantity requires spontaneous emission which is inherently uncontrollable. What place is there then for control, let alone optimal control, using external fields? We discuss the resolution to this paradox with a detailed analysis of cooling in a two-level system.}},

@article{Bahns96,
    abstract = {{A novel scheme is proposed for sequential cooling of rotation, translation, and vibration of molecules. More generally, this scheme manipulates and controls the states and energies of molecules. The scheme, while somewhat complex, is simpler and more feasible than simply providing a large number of synchronously but independently tunable lasers. The key component is a multiple single frequency laser (MSFL) in which a single narrow band pump laser generates an ensemble of resonant ``stimulated Raman'' (RSR) sidebands (subsequently amplified and selected) in a sample of the molecules to be cooled. Starting with a relatively cold molecular sample (e.g., a supersonic beam of Cs2), the rotation of molecules is cooled by sequential application of P branch electronic transition frequencies transverse to the molecular beam beginning at higher rotational angular momentum J. Then translation of molecules is cooled by application of multiple low J, P, and R branch transition frequencies which counterpropagate with the molecular beam and are synchronously chirped over their Doppler profiles. Finally, vibration of molecules is cooled by blocking the R(0) line of the 0–0 band. Only this specific order of rotation–translation–vibration appears feasible (using molecules produced by photoassociation of ultracold atoms avoids the requirement for translational cooling). Each step employs true dissipative cooling (i.e., reduction of system entropy in three degrees of freedom) by spontaneous emission and should yield a large translationally cold sample of molecules in the lowest (v=0, J=0) level of the ground electronic state, suitable for studies such as molecule trapping, ``molecule optics,'' or long range intermolecular states. {\copyright}1996 American Institute of Physics.}},

Similarly, the ability to trap and cool molecules should facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions6; improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also, ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of elementary particles7. But although laser cooling (in the case of alkali metals) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case of hydrogen) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently to permit their loading into magnetic traps, such techniques are not applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading technique12 based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and have used it to trap atomic chromium and europium13,14. Here we apply this technique to magnetically trap a molecular species—calcium monohydride (CaH). We use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number of trapped molecules and their temperature, and set upper bounds on the cross-sectional areas of collisional relaxation processes. The technique should be applicable to many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.}},

    abstract = {{Symmetrically substituted diacetylene compounds, which shows large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, have been theoretically investigated by the ab initio molecular-orbital method employing several theoretical models including the configuration interaction with single excitation (CIS), random phase approximation (RPA), and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) methods. The calculated excited energies are overestimated by CIS or RPA, whereas underestimated by TDDFT with the B3LYP parametrization for both one-photon absorption (OPA) and TPA allowed states. The lowest OPA state is well described by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition. On the other hand, lower TPA allowed states can be represented as the superposition of the HOMO-LUMO+1 and HOMO\&\#150;1-LUMO transitions, giving rise to two TPA allowed states. The absorption intensity for the lower TPA state of the diacetylenes molecules is discussed in terms of the alternancy symmetry and its breaking. The symmetry property is differently manifested for neutral and dicationic diacetylenes. Introduction of charges breaks the alternancy symmetry, which gives rise to an increase in the TPA cross sections at the lower frequency. The upper TPA state is calculated to show huge TPA cross sections, which reproduces the enhancement of the TPA cross section experimentally observed for one of the diacetylenes at the higher-frequency region. The enhancement is discussed employing an index defined as the ratio of the transition polarizability and its static limit, which represents the degree of influence of one-photon resonance on the TPA intensity. The huge TPA cross sections are found to be due to a near-resonance effect. The present theoretical calculation approves the previously proposed assumption based on the four-state (dual three-state) model, which consists of the ground, one OPA allowed, and two TPA allowed states.

of two possible regular patterns, which maximize the cooperative scattering of light into the cavity

energy related to the cavity linewidth. The self-organization starts only above a threshold of the pump

The time development of both the exact and the MCSCF reference state have been parametrized in terms of explicit exponential time-dependent transformations. The time development has been determined by requiring the Ehrenfest theorem to be satisfied through each order in the interaction between the molecular system and the field. The response of the exact and the MCSCF reference state has been used to evaluate linear, quadratic, and cubic response functions. It has been shown how a large variety of molecular properties may be expressed in terms of these response functions. It has also been demonstrated that molecular properties containing the electric dipole operator may be expressed in equivalent forms involving the momentum operator both for the exact and the MCSCF state. The MCSCF response functions have been transformed to computationally attractive expressions which do not contain summation indices over intermediate states and which allow direct techniques to be straightforwardly applied.}},

The probability of chemical reactions and collisional energy transfer can be very large at temperatures near zero kelvin. The collision energy of ultracold atoms and molecules is much smaller than perturbations due to interactions with external electric or magnetic fields available in the laboratory.

The CO was detected by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization at various rotational states of CO ( J = 5\&ndash;45) and the CO velocity distributions were measured using state-resolved DC Slice Imaging. These high-resolution measurements reveal the internal state distribution of the correlated H\$\_{2}\$ cofragments. The results show that the rotationally hot CO ( J \$\_{CO}\$ = 40) is produced in conjunction with vibrationally cold H\$\_{2}\$ fragments (\&nu; = 0\&ndash;3), consistent with dissociation through the celebrated skewed transition state. After excitation of formaldehyde at energies near and above the threshold for dissociation to radical products (H\$\_{2}\$CO \&rarr; H+HCO), a second molecular elimination channel appears which is characterized by rotationally cold CO ( J \&tilde; 5\&ndash;15) correlated with highly vibrationally excited H\$\_{2}\$ (\&nu; = 5\&ndash;7). These products are formed through a novel roaming H-atom mechanism that involves intramolecular H abstraction and avoids the region of the transition state to molecular elimination entirely.

    abstract = {{Extended MR-CISD (multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles), MR-CISD + Q (multireference configuration interaction singles, doubles, and quadrupole), and MR-AQCC (multireference averaged quadratic coupled clusters) calculations have been performed on the following valence states of formaldehyde: 1 1A1 (planar ground state), 1 1A2 and 1 1A (planar and nonplanar n-* state), 1 1B1 and 2 1A1 (planar -* and -* states) and their nonplanar counterparts 2 1A and 3 1A. Full geometry optimizations have been performed using analytic gradient techniques developed for the MR-CISD and MR-AQCC methods as implemented into the COLUMBUS program system. Basis set extrapolation techniques have been used for the determination of high-accuracy geometries and adiabatic excitation energies. Harmonic vibrational frequencies have been computed also. Agreement between calculated and available experimental data is very good. Especially for the -* and -* states experimental information is extremely scarce and our results provide reliable predictions. The major new result of our work is the finding that for the 2 1A1(-*) state the structure optimized under planarity constraints is only a saddle point and not a minimum. This fact is the result of a conical intersection between the -* and -* states (1 1B1 and 2 1A1). The final result is that neither on the 2 1A nor on the 3 1A surface a stationary minimum can be assigned to the -* state. \&copy;2001 American Institute of Physics.}},

For this purpose, the previously developed potential energy function [T. Yonehara and S. Kato, J. Chem. Phys. 117, 11131 (2002)] is refined to give accurate transition state energies and to describe the radical dissociation channel. The cumulative reaction probabilities for the molecular dissociation and two isomerization channels are calculated by using the full Watson Hamiltonian. We also carry out wave packet dynamics calculations starting from the transition state region for the molecular dissociation. A contracted basis set for the angular coordinates is constructed to reduce the size of dynamics calculations. The intramolecular vibrational relaxation dynamics is found to be fast and almost complete within 300\&nbsp;\&nbsp;fs. Using the energy filtered wave functions, the time propagation of HCOH population is obtained in the energy range from 81\&nbsp;\&nbsp;to\&nbsp;\&nbsp;94\&nbsp;\&nbsp;kcal/mol. The branching ratio of the radical product is estimated by calculating the time dependent reactive fluxes to the molecular and radical dissociation products.

    abstract = {{A class of molecular two-photon processes; occurring under transient or steady-state conditions; is analyzed exactly for certain cases using a density-matrix formalism. Our results are relevant to the recently observed phenomena of transient coherent Raman beats and steady-state two-photon absorption of oppositely directed laser beams. Lowest-order perturbation theories have shown that these processes are insensitive to the Doppler effect; and consequently the linewidth is unaffected by Doppler broadening and by elastic collisions that change molecular velocity. The solutions presented here are of the same form for the Raman and two-photon problems and reveal significant power-dependent frequency shifts and line broadening that correct the ideal Doppler-free solutions. For the transient case; we assume a molecular three-level quantum structure that can be switched in or out of optical resonance with cw laser radiation by means of a pulsed dc Stark field; but the solutions also apply when resonant optical pulses are introduced. During the resonant condition when the Stark pulse is on; the three levels are prepared in coherent superposition; and during the nonresonant condition following the Stark pulse; the laser field(s) stimulates the coherently prepared sample in a transient two-photon process. One of these processes; the Ramanbeat effect; has been observed in forward scattering; but the second one; transient two-photon emission; should be observable in backward scattering. Bloch-like equations are derived for this three-level problem that facilitate an exact pulse solution for state preparation. Following the pulse; transient decay is well-approximated by a perturbation calculation. For the steady-state case; an exact solution is also obtained and is of interest for continuous-wave spectroscopy or for transient experiments requiring an initial preparation of quantum states; prior to Stark switching. These solutions exhibit a power-dependent line broadening and a frequency shift of magnitude \^{a}¼\^{I}(\^{I}± 2 -\^{I}² 2 )/(\^{I} 2 +1/ T 2 2 ); in agreement with our earlier estimate; where \^{I}± and \^{I}² are the Rabi flopping frequencies for the two intermediate transitions and \^{I} is the off-resonance tuning behavior for one of them.}},

difficult. For instance, laser cooling of hydrogen requires single-frequency vacuum-ultraviolet light, while
multielectron atoms need single-frequency light at many widely separated frequencies. These restrictions can
be eased by laser cooling on two-photon transitions with ultrafast pulse trains. Laser cooling of hydrogen,
antihydrogen, and many other species appears feasible, and extension of the technique to molecules may be
possible.}},

    abstract = {{A stochastic method of optimization, which combines simulated annealing with simplex, is implemented to fit the parameters of a simple model potential. The main characteristic of the method is that it explores the whole space of the parameters of the model potential, and therefore it is very efficient in locating the global minimum of the cost function, in addition to being independent of the initial guess of the parameters. The method is employed to fit the complex intermolecular potential energy surface of the dimer of water, using as a reference the spectroscopic quality anisotropic site-site potential of Feller et al. The simple model potential chosen for its reparameterization is the MCY model potential of Clementi et al. The quality of the fit is assessed by comparing the geometry of the minimum, the harmonic frequencies, and the second virial coefficients of the parameterized potential with the reference one. Finally, to prove more rigorously the robustness of this method, it is compared with standard nonstochastic methods of optimization. \&copy; 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{citeulike:80546,
    abstract = {{Nonperturbative quantum control schemes in the intermediate field strength nonionizing regime are investigated.
We restrict the matter-field interaction to the nonresonant dynamic Stark effect NRDSE as induced by
infrared laser fields, which we argue is a new and general tool for quantum control of atomic and molecular
dynamics. For the case of Raman coupled matter states, an effective Hamiltionian may be constructed, and
quantum control via NRDSE may be thought of as reversibly modifying the effective Hamiltonian during
system propagation, thus leading to control over dynamic processes. As an illustration, the creation of field-free
 ” switched” wave packets through the adiabatic turn on and sudden turn off of the NRDSE is considered and
experimentally demonstrated. Wave packets generated through the switched NRDSE interaction may be very
different in form and content than wave packets generated via resonant transitions with Gaussian optical
pulses. In order to provide an example, we discuss the specific case of rotational wave packet dynamics where
the NRDSE manifests itself as molecular axis alignment. This technique is applied to the creation of field-free
molecular axis alignment using an intense switched 1.064 m laser pulse. This switched laser pulse was
generated via a plasma shuttering technique, giving a pulse with a rise time of 150 ps and a fall time of 170 fs.
The temporal evolution of the molecular axis alignment is probed via the optical Kerr effect. Field-free
alignment via the switched NRDSE is demonstrated for both linear CO2, CS2 and symmetric top 1,2-
propadiene polyatomic molecules.}},

@article{Rahav10aamop,
    abstract = {Coherent nonlinear optical signals are commonly calculated using a semiclassical approach that assumes a quantum system interacting with classical fields. Compact expressions for the signals are then derived in terms of nonlinear susceptibilities. We present an alternative approach based on a quantum description of both matter and field. The signals are further recast in terms of transition amplitudes, which provide a clearer picture for the underlying molecular processes and may be intuitively represented by closed-time-path-loop diagrams. Unlike the semiclassical approach that treats the signal mode macroscopically using Maxwell's equations, the present formalism allows for a fully microscopic calculation of the entire process. For example, n + 1 wave mixing appears as a concerted n + 1 photon event and all n + 1 field modes (including the signal) are treated on the same footing. Resonant contributions to nonlinear optical signals that carry useful molecule-specific information are recast as the modulus square of transition amplitudes and are clearly separated from the parametric background. Purely dissipative signals that can be measured using a collinear beam geometry and manipulated by pulse shaping techniques are proposed. The approach is demonstrated by applications to the stimulated Raman and the two-photon absorption components of pump–probe, and to coherent {anti-Stokes} Raman spectroscopy.},
